Hawaii criminal background check law (aka Ban the Box legislation) is expansive:
* It is illegal for employers to ask job applicants if they have been convicted of a crime (HRS §378-2.5) 
* Employers may not discriminate in hiring, firing, compensation, or other terms of employment based on an applicant or employee’s arrest or court record.
* Inquiries into criminal history can be made, but only after the applicant receives a conditional offer of employment
* Some employers can inquire into an individual's criminal history. This includes schools, certain government positions, armed security providers, and financial/insurance institutions
* Hawaii criminal history records are public information available through the Hawaii Criminal Justice Data Center
* Job offers may be withdrawn only if the conviction “bears a rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the position”. There is a high standard for proving “rational relationship”

If you have a felony conviction, you may not vote while incarcerated.  After you are released, you may vote. You may vote if you have a misdemeanor conviction.  If you are incarcerated due to a misdemeanor conviction, you must use an absentee ballot.

Once you are released from incarceration you must register/re-register to vote. You may vote while on parole or probation. You don’t need any special documentation. If you do not have a photo or other identification, you will be asked your birthday and residence address to corroborate with the information in the poll book.
